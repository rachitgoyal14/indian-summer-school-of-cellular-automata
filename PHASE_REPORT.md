# Phase Reports

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding

- Implemented: Repo skeleton, config system (`src/core/config.py`, `configs/intersection_default.yaml`), logging setup (`src/core/logging_setup.py`), `scripts/download_data.py` (which fetches and standardizes the real Kanagaraj dataset), and the exploratory notebook.
- Test results:
  ```
  ..                                                                       [100%]
  2 passed in 0.68s
  ```
- Assumption/Simplification: 
  - Real Kanagaraj data was successfully downloaded and used instead of the synthetic fallback. 
  - Real paper values (from `base.pdf`) were incorporated ahead of schedule to avoid placeholders: The `grid` parameters in `configs/intersection_default.yaml` use the exact lengths from the base paper (Eq 7, 8, 9): `cell_length_m: 0.5`, `cell_width_m: 0.7`, `lane_width_m: 3.5`.
  - Also pulled in the exact calibration parameters from Table 2 and the IZOI distances from Table 1, which will be added directly into configurations in later phases.
- Deferred TODOs: None.
